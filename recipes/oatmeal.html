<h2>Description</h2>
<p>So you've given up on life. Maybe the strain of making a proper

    century English dreams of eating gruel, or maybe you burned off 
    your tastebuds in a freak accident. Whether you're too busy or 
    you've gone overboard on your pauper cosplay, this is the recipe 
    for you.
