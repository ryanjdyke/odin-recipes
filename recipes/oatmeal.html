<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="description">So you've given up on life. Maybe the strain of making a proper
    breakfast is too great, maybe you'd like to act out your 17th 
    century English dreams of eating gruel, or maybe you burned off 
    your tastebuds in a freak accident. Whether you're too busy or 
    you've gone overboard on your pauper cosplay, this is the recipe 
    for you.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup of oats (quick oats are best, but rolled add that poverty texture)</li>
    <li>1 cup of milk (substitute water to limit excess flavor)</li>
    <li>1 bowl</li>
    <li>1 spoon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add oats and liquid to a pot</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil, then cook over low heat for 20 minutes</li>
    <li>Pour oatmeal into bowl</li>
    <li>Fend off nearby plague mice as you "enjoy" your meal</li>
</ol>
