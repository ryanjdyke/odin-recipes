<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You've done it all. Filet Mignon, Boullabaisse, and Beef Wellington.
    Now you're ready for the big leagues, son, and you're gonna need all
    the skills you've got. Today we're staring down the barrel of a bowl
    of cereal. No matter who you are, you'll fail the first few times. 
    Even Julia Childs once wrote "To make cereal one must first find the 
    darkest part of one's soul and be consumed by it". You think you're 
    ready? You're wrong.
